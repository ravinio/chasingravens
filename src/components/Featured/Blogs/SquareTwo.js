                          DISCLAIMER: In the UK, the culture surrounding tipping differs from that in the US. Unlike in the US, where tipping is customary and often considered an integral part of the service industry, tipping in the UK is not as prevalent or expected. Consequently, UK servers may appear more reserved or less focused on constantly engaging with customers, as they tend to prioritize efficient service without excessive small talk.
                          Due to this difference, we are rating this category on a scale of 1-3: 1 is awful and they were rude, 2 is fine and got the job done, and 3 is they talked to us and smiled.

                          Chase ordered the Truffle Bacon & Rich Yolk Sunny Side Eggs that came with THE BEST MUSHROOM WE HAVE EVER HAD. Ravin's americano and croissant was also fantastic but the mushroom is something we will talk about for a long time. It was so damn good, like really.
